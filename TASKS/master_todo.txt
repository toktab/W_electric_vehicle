EV CHARGING PROJECT - MASTER TODO LIST

Student: Your Name
Deadline: Week of December 16, 2025
Status: IN PROGRESS

CURRENT BLOCKING BUG (FIX FIRST!)
==================================

CRITICAL TASKS (Required for passing)
======================================

TASK 1: Fix CP Authentication Flow
Status: NOT STARTED
Priority: CRITICAL
File: TASK1-AUTHENTICATION.txt
Estimated time: 2-3 days

What's wrong:
- CPs currently skip Registry and connect directly to Central
- No credential verification happens
- No security at all

What you need:
- CP_Monitor must fetch credentials from Registry first
- CP_Monitor authenticates with Central using those credentials
- Central verifies with Registry before allowing CP to operate

TASK 2: Implement Symmetric Encryption
Status: NOT STARTED
Priority: CRITICAL
File: TASK2-ENCRYPTION.txt
Estimated time: 3-4 days

What's wrong:
- All messages between CP and Central are plain text
- Anyone can read/modify messages
- Zero security

What you need:
- After authentication, Central gives each CP a unique encryption key
- CP_Engine encrypts all messages to Central
- Central decrypts all messages from CPs
- Each CP has different key

TASK 3: Create Proper Audit Log
Status: NOT STARTED
Priority: CRITICAL
File: TASK3-AUDIT-LOG.txt
Estimated time: 1 day

What's wrong:
- No audit log file exists
- Kafka events exist but teacher can't see them
- No IP address tracking

What you need:
- Create data/audit_log.txt file
- Log every important action with: timestamp, IP, who, what, parameters
- Teacher must be able to open this file and see everything that happened

TASK 4: Add HTTPS to Registry
Status: NOT STARTED
Priority: HIGH
File: TASK4-HTTPS-REGISTRY.txt
Estimated time: 1 day

What's wrong:
- Registry uses HTTP (insecure)
- Anyone can intercept credentials
- Correction guide requires HTTPS/SSL

What you need:
- Generate self-signed SSL certificate
- Make Registry API run on HTTPS
- Update CP_Monitor to connect via HTTPS

TASK 5: Fix Key Revocation Mechanism
Status: PARTIALLY DONE
Priority: MEDIUM
File: TASK5-KEY-REVOCATION.txt
Estimated time: 1 day

What's wrong:
- Admin menu has "revoke key" option but doesn't work
- CP doesn't realize its key was revoked
- No re-authentication happens

What you need:
- When admin revokes key, CP's messages get rejected
- CP sees "bad key" error
- CP must re-authenticate to get new key
- All without restarting anything

RECOMMENDED WORK SCHEDULE
==========================

Week 1 (Now - Dec 16):
- Day 1: Fix CP persistence bug (BUG-001)
- Day 2-3: Implement authentication flow (TASK 1)
- Day 4-6: Implement encryption (TASK 2)
- Day 7: Create audit log (TASK 3)

Week 2 (Dec 16-23):
- Day 1: Add HTTPS to Registry (TASK 4)
- Day 2: Fix key revocation (TASK 5)
- Day 3-4: Test everything together
- Day 5-6: Deploy on 3 computers and practice demonstration
- Day 7: Final testing and prepare for correction

PROGRESS TRACKER
=================

Task              Status          Time Spent    Notes
BUG-001           Not Started     0h            MUST DO FIRST
TASK 1            Not Started     0h            
TASK 2            Not Started     0h            
TASK 3            Not Started     0h            
TASK 4            Not Started     0h            
TASK 5            Not Started     0h            

Legend:
- Not Started
- In Progress
- Completed
- Blocked/Issues

WHAT TEACHER WILL CHECK
========================

During correction, the teacher will:
1. ✅ Ask you to deploy on 3 different computers
2. ❌ Ask you to explain authentication flow (CAN'T - not implemented)
3. ❌ Ask to see encrypted messages (CAN'T - not implemented)
4. ❌ Ask to see audit log file (CAN'T - doesn't exist)
5. ✅ Ask to create/delete CPs dynamically (works if bug fixed)
6. ❌ Ask about key revocation (doesn't work properly)
7. ✅ Test resilience by killing processes randomly (mostly works)
8. ❌ Check HTTPS on Registry (not implemented)

Current score estimate: 3-4 out of 10 points
After fixing everything: 8-9 out of 10 points

NOTES TO REMEMBER
=================

- Don't panic - you have good foundation, just missing security
- Fix the CP bug FIRST before doing anything else
- Authentication must come before encryption (can't encrypt without keys)
- Test each task thoroughly before moving to next one
- Keep this file updated with your progress

IF YOU GET STUCK
================

1. Re-read the task file for that specific task
2. Check the correction guide requirements
3. Test in small steps (don't try to do everything at once)
4. If a task blocks you for more than 4 hours, move to next one and come back later
